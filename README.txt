Abstract:
We propose a novel method that infers the employment effect of a minimum wage increase by
comparing the number of excess jobs paying at or slightly above the new minimum wage to the
missing jobs paying below it. To implement our approach, we estimate the effect of the minimum
wage on the frequency distribution of hourly wages using 138 prominent state-level minimum
wage changes between 1979 and 2016. We find that the overall number of low-wage jobs
remained essentially unchanged over five years following the increase. At the same time, the
direct effect of the minimum wage on average earnings was amplified by modest wage spillovers
at the bottom of the wage distribution. Our estimates by detailed demographic groups show that
the lack of job loss is not explained by labor-labor substitution at the bottom of the wage
distribution. We also find no evidence of disemployment when we consider higher levels of
minimum wages. However, we do find some evidence of reduced employment in tradable
sectors. In contrast to our bunching-based estimates, we show that some conventional studies can
produce misleading inference due to spurious changes in employment higher up in the wage
distribution.

ChatGPT Prompt:
write a python script that estimates the effect of minimum wage changes on the number of excess jobs paying at or slightly above the minimum wage using a csv file. The minimum wage changes occur between 1979 and 2016 and are in the column labeled "mw".  Clean and transform the data, and visualize it with a time-series graph.

Paper: 
“THE EFFECT OF MINIMUM WAGES ON LOW-WAGE JOBS: EVIDENCE FROM THE UNITED STATES USING A BUNCHING ESTIMATOR” by Doruk Cengiz, Arindrajit Dube, Attila Lindner, and Ben Zipperer

Objective: 
To examine and analyze the effects of minimum wage increases on the amount of low-wage jobs (excess jobs at or above minimum wage).

Methodology & Instrument: 
The study uses propensity score matching and a bunching estimator to estimate the effect of minimum wage increase on the frequency distribution of hourly wages for 138 state-level minimum wage changes.

Reason: 
This study was done to potentially allow policymakers to better understand and therefore control the effects of future minimum wage changes in order to prevent potential low-wage job losses.

Data: 
Uses data on state-level annual wage changes and juxtaposes said data with data on the amount of excess jobs in the economy.

Results: 
Overall number of low-wage jobs remained the same with minimum wage increases, but wage spillovers did occur near the bottom of the wage distribution, causing a decrease in average earnings.
